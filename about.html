<center><p> My name is Harold Aldana there isnt that much to know about me, except the fact that I love cars. I am a computer science major student at uri,<br>
    The reason I chose to study computer science is because when I was 13 I took apart a my phone In order to put it in a custom purple houseing that I bought off<br>
    of Ebay. After, I did that housing swap I felt like the coolest kid on the block. Afterwards I seemed to be very interested in technology and after that I bpught<br>
    old windows Desktop and took it apart and Put it all back together and it seemed so fun for me. Ive always been good with my hands because, While I was growing up<br> 
    one of my uncles has his landscaping company and the other one is a mechanic. So, I would always work with them as a kid, and I acquired skills with my hands.<br> 
    When I was graduated from high school, I was planning to follow my passion And that would be cars my uncle had a 500hp race car and the rush of driving that car <br>
    made me fall in love with cars. so, I planned to go to New England Tech for high performace automotive but then I realized that race cars are expensive and that <br>
    cars are all computers. They have a ECU, A ECU is a computer that tells the engine what to do. Later on, I found out that auto techs do not get paid well and <br>
    and I was heartbroken because I plan to build at least 3 race cars and if I decided to be an auto tech this dream of nice would not come true. Then a light turned<br> 
    on in my head and I thought " I know how to work on computers, why not learn to program them and do that for a living and get enough money for your race cars?"<br>
    Another reason why I came to college and is my legit reason for coming to college is because my mom migrated to the US from her home country (Guatemala} to give<br>
    my sister and I a better chance in life. When she was a kid she didn'r get the chance to go to school, and she wants to make sure my sister and I get all the <br>
    opporrtunities she didn't get. Her dream is for my sister and I to graduate from college,and I am making my efforts for her dream to come true, <br> 
    <strong>That is the only motivation fueling me to graduate from college</strong></p></center>
